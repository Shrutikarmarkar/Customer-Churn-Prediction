# Customer-Churn-
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning to predict customer churn for a business. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical metric for businesses, and predicting it accurately can aid in implementing targeted strategies to retain valuable customers.

## Project Details
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict customer churn by analyzing various factors that contribute to customer attrition. By employing machine learning techniques, we aim to build models that can identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them.

### Data
The dataset used in this project contains a comprehensive set of features related to customer behavior, interactions, and usage patterns. These features serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the predictive models.

### Models Explored
In this project, we explore several machine learning algorithms for classification, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. These models are trained and evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

### Results and Insights
Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the factors that significantly influence customer churn. Additionally, the trained models serve as predictive tools for businesses, enabling them to proactively identify and engage with customers at risk of churning. This, in turn, allows for the implementation of targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition.
